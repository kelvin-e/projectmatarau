        <h3>Kainga &mdash; Nau mai, Haere mai ki Tokomaru Akau</h3>
        <p>Tokomaru Bay is a small beachside community located on the isolated East Coast of New Zealand’s North Island. It is 91 km north of Gisborne, on State Highway 35, and close to Mount Hikurangi. The Coastal township 91 km north of Gisborne and 11 km south of Te Puia Springs on State Highway 35, with a population of 390 in 2013.</p>
        <p>The ancestral mountain Marotiri is clearly visible from the town, which is bisected by the ancestral river Mangahauini. Tuatini, one of four marae in the town, is home to St Mary’s church. Established in 1885, it is the oldest church in the district.</p>
        <p>In 2013 over 80% of the population were Māori, and, of those, most belonged to Te Whānau-a-Ruataupare and Te Whānau-a-Te Aotawarirangi hapū. The district was once called Toka-a-Namu, referring to the abundance of sandflies (namu).</p>
        <p>In the 1840s shore whaling took place from Tokomaru Bay. A battle between Pai Mārire (Hauhau) forces and local Māori took place at Māwhai Point on the southern side of the bay in August 1865. The depleted defenders, including many women, were victorious.</p>
        <p>In the later 19th century the bay became a center for the local pastoral industry. A post office opened in 1890. At Waimā, on the north side of the bay, a freezing works was established in 1911 and the wharf was extended to take overseas ships. The works closed in 1952 and the harbour ceased to be used in 1963, but ruins of the works and the old wharf were still evident in the early 2000s.</p>
        <p>Artists and craftspeople, including musicians, painters and potters, have made their home in Tokomaru Bay; it is considered the craft centre of the coast. Te Puka tavern, on the road to Waimā, has great food and wonderful views of the bay.</p>
        <p>The highest point on State Highway 35 (171 m) is reached just south of Tokomaru Bay.</p>
